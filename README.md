On this project I played a little bit with drag and drop and I have also put all kind of conditions, such as: 
if I move a task into "Blocked" section, I need a reason; 
I cannot move a task from "Not started" directly to "Done"; 
when I create a new task, this goes directly to "Not started"; 
on Manager Mode I can add new users;
also, if I create a new task, it goes directly to "Undefined"; 
if I want to move it to "Not started" I have to assign it to someone.
